# üé´ Coupon System Setup Guide

## üö® **IMPORTANT: Fix RLS Policies First**

The coupon system is not working because of Row Level Security (RLS) policy issues. Follow these steps to fix it:

### Step 1: Run the RLS Fix Migration

```sql
-- Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor
-- Fix RLS policies for coupons table to allow admin operations

-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read access to active coupons" ON public.coupons;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow admin full access" ON public.coupons;

-- Create new policies for coupons
-- Allow public read access to active coupons
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access to active coupons" ON public.coupons
    FOR SELECT USING (is_active = true AND expires_at > NOW());

-- Allow authenticated users to read all coupons (for admin panel)
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to read all coupons" ON public.coupons
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Allow authenticated users to insert coupons (for admin panel)
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to insert coupons" ON public.coupons
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Allow authenticated users to update coupons (for admin panel)
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to update coupons" ON public.coupons
    FOR UPDATE USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Allow authenticated users to delete coupons (for admin panel)
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to delete coupons" ON public.coupons
    FOR DELETE USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Fix coupon_usage policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own coupon usage" ON public.coupon_usage;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own coupon usage" ON public.coupon_usage;

-- Allow users to view their own coupon usage
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own coupon usage" ON public.coupon_usage
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Allow users to insert their own coupon usage
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own coupon usage" ON public.coupon_usage
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Allow authenticated users to read all coupon usage (for admin)
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to read all coupon usage" ON public.coupon_usage
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

### Step 2: Run All Migrations

Make sure you run these migrations in order:

1. **Create coupons table:**
   ```bash
   # Run the create_coupons_table.sql migration
   ```

2. **Add coupon fields to orders:**
   ```bash
   # Run the add_coupon_to_orders.sql migration
   ```

3. **Fix RLS policies:**
   ```bash
   # Run the fix_coupon_rls_policies.sql migration
   ```

### Step 3: Test the System

1. **Admin Panel:**
   - Go to `/admin`
   - Click on "Coupons" tab
   - Try creating a new coupon
   - Try editing/deleting existing coupons

2. **Customer Experience:**
   - Go to `/cart`
   - Add items to cart
   - Click "Proceed to Checkout"
   - Click "View Available Coupons" button
   - Select a coupon to apply
   - Complete the checkout process

## üéØ **How the New Coupon Button Works**

### For Customers:
1. **In Checkout Modal**: Click "View Available Coupons" button
2. **Select Coupon**: Choose from available coupons
3. **Apply Discount**: Coupon is applied with discount shown
4. **Complete Order**: Only after successful payment, coupon is marked as used

### For Admins:
1. **Create Coupons**: Set discount type, value, expiry, usage limits
2. **Manage Coupons**: Edit, delete, activate/deactivate
3. **Track Usage**: See statistics and usage counts
4. **Monitor Performance**: Real-time analytics

## üöÄ **Quick Test**

After running the migrations:

1. **Create a test coupon:**
   - Code: `TEST10`
   - Type: Fixed amount
   - Value: ‚Çπ100
   - Min order: ‚Çπ500
   - Expiry: 30 days from now

2. **Test customer flow:**
   - Add items worth ‚Çπ1000+ to cart
   - Go to checkout
   - Click "View Available Coupons"
   - Apply the TEST10 coupon
   - See ‚Çπ100 discount applied
   - Complete payment

3. **Verify admin panel:**
   - Check coupon usage count increased
   - Verify coupon cannot be used again by same user

## üêõ **Troubleshooting**

### If you still get RLS errors:
1. Check if you're logged in as admin
2. Verify the RLS policies were applied correctly
3. Check browser console for specific error messages

### If coupons don't show in checkout:
1. Verify coupons are active and not expired
2. Check if user is logged in
3. Verify minimum order value requirements

### If coupon doesn't apply:
1. Check if user has already used this coupon
2. Verify order amount meets minimum requirements
3. Check if coupon is still active

## üìû **Support**

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify all migrations were run successfully
3. Ensure you're logged in with proper admin credentials
